# CalHacks 2024 Project: DayTalks
DayTalks is a mental health-focused web application designed to help users track and reflect on their emotional well-being.

By leveraging cutting-edge AI and emotional analysis tools like HumeAI, the app creates a supportive environment where users can express themselves freely and receive meaningful feedback. By offering real-time feedback, DayTalks empowers users to understand their emotions better and take proactive steps to enhance their well-being.
